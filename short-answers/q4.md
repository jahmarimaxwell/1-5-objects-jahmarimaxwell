# Question

Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer

A JSON is a text that represents a JS object as a string. An object can be turned into a JSON with the `JSON.stringified()` method and vice versa with the `JSON.parse()`. The example above is not a valid JSON because the keys are not double-quoted strings.
