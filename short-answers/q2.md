# Question

What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer

"Pass by value" means that the value of the variable is passed as an argument, while "pass by reference" means that the reference of the variable is the one that is passed as argument, therefore it affects the variable too.
