# Question

We learned about destructuring both objects and arrays. So, assuming we had these two variables:

```js
const user = {
  name: "Zo",
  age: 28,
};

const lapTimes = ["3:07", "3:43", "3:15"];
```

Rewrite the following lines to use destructuring:

```js
const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;

const firstLap = lapTimes[0];
const secondLap = lapTimes[1];
const thirdLap = lapTimes[2];
```

Essentially, define a `name`, `age`, `firstLap`, `secondLap`, and `thirdLap` variable, but use destructuring to do so.

Hint, it only takes 2 lines!

# Answer

```js
const [name, age] = Object.values(user);
const [firstLap, secondLap, thirdLap] = lapTimes;
```
